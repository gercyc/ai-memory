//! `ai-memory install-instructions` — drop the proactive-use snippet
//! into a project's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / other rules file.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Lifecycle hooks handle *capture* and *handoff surfacing*
//! automatically. What they can't do is make the agent *proactively
//! call* `memory_query` / `memory_recent` when it should — that
//! decision lives in the model's system prompt, fed turn-by-turn by
//! the project's CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md.
//!
//! This subcommand drops a small, opinionated snippet into that
//! file. Idempotent via HTML-comment markers so re-running picks up
//! whatever the snippet evolves into without duplicating the block.

## Long-term memory (ai-memory)

This project uses [ai-memory](https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-memory)
for cross-session continuity. **Lifecycle hooks already capture every
prompt + tool call automatically.** You never need to manually write
notes; the SessionStart hook auto-fetches pending handoffs and the
SessionEnd hook auto-consolidates. Just *use* the read tools.

### When to reach for each tool

The user can express any of the intents below in plain English —
match the intent to the tool. They do not need to name the tool.

| User says / situation | Tool |
|---|---|
| "have we discussed X?" / "search memory for Y" / before proposing architecture | `memory_query` |
| "what's been going on" / "show recent activity" (light) | `memory_recent` |
| "is ai-memory healthy?" / "how big is the wiki?" | `memory_status` |
| "give me the stats" / structured snapshot for the agent to consume | `memory_briefing` |
| "catch me up" / "I've been away" / "what's important right now?" / open-ended exploration | `memory_explore` |
| "where did we leave off?" — and you see a `📥 ai-memory: pending handoff` block in your context | already done — answer from that block; do NOT re-call `memory_handoff_accept` |
| "where did we leave off?" — and no such block is visible | `memory_handoff_accept` (rare; the SessionStart hook usually got there first) |
| "save context for the next session" / wrapping up | `memory_handoff_begin` (terse summary; put detail in `open_questions` + `next_steps` bullets) |
| "consolidate this session" / "compile what we learned" (usually automatic) | `memory_consolidate` |
| "audit the wiki" / "find contradictions" / "what rules should we add?" | `memory_lint` |
| "prune old pages" / "memory cleanup" | `memory_forget_sweep` |

`memory_explore` is the right default for the "I want to know what's
going on" use case — it returns a prose digest whose verbosity
scales automatically to how long it's been since the last activity
(< 1 h → one line; > 30 days → full catchup).

### When you write a project rule, write it here

If you're about to write a durable project rule ("always X", "never
Y", "all PRs must …"), this file (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md) is where
the rule belongs. ai-memory's lint pass surfaces the same hint
automatically when a `kind: rule` page lands in `_rules/`.

### Refreshing this snippet

This block is maintained by ai-memory. To re-sync it with the
latest binary's recommended copy (e.g. when new tools ship), run:

```
ai-memory install-instructions
```

It's idempotent: re-runs replace the block bracketed by
`<!-- ai-memory:start -->` / `<!-- ai-memory:end -->` markers
without disturbing the rest of the file.
"#;

/// Run the `install-instructions` subcommand.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns an error if the target path can't be written or if the
/// existing file isn't valid UTF-8.
pub fn run(_config: &Config, args: InstallInstructionsArgs) -> Result<()> {
    let block = format!("{MARKER_START}\n{}\n{MARKER_END}\n", SNIPPET_BODY.trim());

    if args.print {
        // Print mode: show the block + the target path, no mutation.
        println!("# Would write into: {}\n", args.target.display());
        println!("{block}");
        return Ok(());
    }

    let outcome = apply_atomic(&args.target, |existing| {

        }
